title: "Foundations of GLMMs"

# Introduction

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) extend traditional linear models by incorporating both fixed and random effects.^[@gelman2007, p. 22] These models are particularly useful in ecology, epidemiology, and other fields where data have hierarchical or nested structure.^[@mcculloch2008]

In the context of model comparison, the coefficient of determination \( R^2 \) has been adapted for GLMMs by Nakagawa and Schielzeth.^[@nakagawa2013, p. 135]

# Applications

Let us now consider a study on lizard movement and thermoregulation, where hierarchical modeling played a key role in capturing population-level variation.^[@russell2017]

Bayesian approaches to GLMMs have gained popularity due to their flexibility and ability to handle complex hierarchical structures.^[@johnson2020]

A second reference to the same foundational text confirms its continued relevance.^[@gelman2007, p. 118]

# Conclusion

GLMMs are not a panacea, but when applied thoughtfully, they enable sophisticated modeling of structured data.^[@nakagawa2013, p. 140]
