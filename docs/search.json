    "text": "1.1 Applications\nGeneralized linear mixed models (GLMMs) extend traditional linear models by incorporating both fixed and random effects.1 These models are particularly useful in ecology, epidemiology, and other fields where data have hierarchical or nested structure.2\nIn the context of model comparison, the coefficient of determination ( R^2 ) has been adapted for GLMMs by Nakagawa and Schielzeth.3\nLet us now consider a study on lizard movement and thermoregulation, where hierarchical modeling played a key role in capturing population-level variation.4\nBayesian approaches to GLMMs have gained popularity due to their flexibility and ability to handle complex hierarchical structures.5",
